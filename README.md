### Updated R code and data from Gasparrini AJE 2016

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An applications of time-varying DLNMs, specified through an interaction between cross-basis variables and the time variable, to model temporal variations in exposure-lag-response associations between heat and mortality in a multi-country multi-city (MCC) data set. Specifically, this application shows how to model within-season variations, partly reproducing the analysis described in the article:

The code:

  * *regEngWales19902012* stores the daily time series data from 10 locations corresponding to regions of England and Wales in the period 1990--2012
  * the numbered files from *00.prepdata.R* to *05.plots.R*, reproduce the results of an example with the subset of data
